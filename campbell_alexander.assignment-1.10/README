Assignment 1.10
===============

I chose to create an entirely new Roguelike from scratch for this assignment.
This code borrows nothing directly from our work so far this semester, but some
of the ideas are still there :)


Technical Details
-----------------

Please run the game in a terminal of at least 160 x 30 characters!
There is no diagonal movement in this game.

Notice:
 - For whatever reason, std::string::swap during assignment of `const char*` in
   the Boss constructor segfaults on my Slackware VM. I cannot reproduce this
   issue on any other platform or VM. I think it's an issue with my linker /
   stdlib version on that image.
 - Valgrind reports 64 bytes lost. Those bytes seemed to have been lost by
   std::deque.


The Game
--------

The game is played in a dungeon with six floors (seven if you count the town
level). The final floor of the dungeon contains a very tough boss. To defeat the
boss, it is necessary to collect one of the strongest weapons. I would recommend
either the Skeletal Lord's Mace or Lucifer's Blade.

There are only two equipment slots: your weapon and your Ring. There is no
inventory. To take a new weapon, you must drop your old weapon.

Rings are destroyed upon use (with the 'r' key). Several Rings exist in the
dungeon, including grass Rings, which teleport the player back to the town
level. This is useful because the town contains a healing fountain.

When you begin the game, you choose among three races. Each race has a specific
perk that will aid you throughout the dungeon-- for instance, elves can see
enemies and items from farther away.

The game is pretty easy, so you should be able to beat the boss without dying
more than once or twice. Good luck!


Size
----

The code takes up some 1600 lines, written between April 12 and April 21. Note
that all of the monster and item prototypes are included in the source code--
there are no configuration files.
